# A bit about me

Hi, I'm Maurice.

I'm an amateur programmer. I program mainly in JS, but also the occasional bit of C.  
I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at university.  
I will be using this account to share various programs, such as Tampermonkey userScripts or scripts for the game *Bitburner*.
